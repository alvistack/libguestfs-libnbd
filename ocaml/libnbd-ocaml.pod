=head1 NAME

libnbd-ocaml - how to use libnbd from OCaml

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 let nbd = NBD.create () in
 NBD.connect_uri nbd "nbd://localhost";
 let size = NBD.get_size nbd in
 printf "%Ld\n" size;
 NBD.close ()

Alternate syntax which ensures that close is called even if an
exception is thrown:

 let size =
   NBD.with_handle (
     fun nbd ->
       NBD.connect_uri nbd "nbd://localhost";
       NBD.get_size nbd
   ) in
 printf "%Ld\n" size

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to use libnbd to access Network Block
Device (NBD) servers from the OCaml programming language.

The OCaml bindings work very similarly to the C bindings so you should
start by reading L<libnbd(3)>.

For OCaml API documentation see L<NBD(3)>.

=head1 HANDLES

Create a libnbd handle of type C<NBD.t> by calling S<C<NBD.create ()>>.

You can either close the handle explicitly by calling C<NBD.close> or
it will be closed automatically when it is garbage collected.  If you
call any other method on a handle which you have explicitly closed
then the API will throw an C<NBD.Closed> exception.

C<NBD.with_handle> can be used to make sure the handle is closed in a
timely manner.  See the example in the L</SYNOPSIS> above.

=head1 ERRORS

Libnbd errors are turned automatically into S<C<NBD.Error (str, errno)>>
exceptions.  This exception has two parameters.  The first is a string
which is the printable error message.  The second is the raw C<errno>,
if available (see L<nbd_get_errno(3)>).  The raw C<errno> is not
compatible with errors in the OCaml C<Unix> module unfortunately.
