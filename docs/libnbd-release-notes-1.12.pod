libnbd-release-notes-1.12 - release notes for libnbd 1.12

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for libnbd stable release 1.12.
This describes the major changes since 1.10.

libnbd 1.12.0 was released on B<XX Xxxxx 2022>.

=head2 Security

There were no security bugs found in libnbd during this release cycle.

If you find a security issue, please read F<SECURITY> in the source
(online here:
L<https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/blob/master/SECURITY>).  To
find out about previous security issues in libnbd, see
L<libnbd-security(3)>.

=head2 New APIs

No new APIs were added in 1.12.

=head2 Enhancements to existing APIs

Error messages about incorrect URIs in L<nbd_connect_uri(3)> have been
improved to make common mistakes clearer for the user.

=head2 Tools

New syntax: C<nbdinfo [ CMD ... ]> allowing you to query the
properties of an NBD server directly.

=head2 Tests

Adopt libvirt-ci's F<ci/gitlab.yml> (Martin Kletzander).

Fix the OCaml extents example (thanks Laszlo Ersek).

=head2 Other improvements and bug fixes

New OCaml C<NBD.with_handle> helper which ensures that C<NBD.close> is
always called even if the inner code throws an exception.

The OCaml bindings now consistently use the correct types for buffer
sizes everywhere (Laszlo Ersek).

Several improvements and fixes to the golang bindings and tests.  The
golang bindings have been relicensed to LGPLv2+ like the rest of the
library and are now published as a golang module at
L<https://libguestfs.org/libnbd> (Nir Soffer).

The Python bindings no longer crash if you pass C<None> in place of a
buffer parameter.  In addition some memory leaks were fixed (Eric
Blake).

Various memory leaks have been fixed when using the optional
strict_mode settings (Eric Blake).

The performance of the internal vector library has been improved
greatly and overflow is now handled correctly (Nir Soffer, Laszlo
Ersek and Eric Blake).

=head2 Documentation

Document the limits on lengths and sizes of parameters to various APIs
(Eric Blake).

=head2 Build

You can now build programs that use the OCaml bindings of libnbd
against the libnbd build directory instead of requiring libnbd to be
installed (Laszlo Ersek).

Compatibility with OCaml 4.13.

Line locations in the state machine should be more accurate when
stepping through with a debugger like gdb.
